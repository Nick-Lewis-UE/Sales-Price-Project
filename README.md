# Sales-Price-Project

This file contains the report to Final Project that my partner and I completed in our Linear Modeling class at the University of Evansville. The data was given to us by our professor with a theoretical scenario. Our task was "given" to us by a city tax assessor. 

We were asked to create a model that would enable him to predict the sales price of homes in his specific location. The body of the report references several appendices, the last of which contains all the code used throughout the report and the output where applicable.
